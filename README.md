# SMS Spam SVM Classification
Info:
1) kernel specifies the kernel type to be used in the algorithm, and 'rbf' and 'sigmoid' are two possible options.
2) C is a regularization parameter that controls the trade-off between achieving a low training error and a low testing error.
3) gamma is a parameter that defines the shape of the decision boundary, and a higher gamma leads to a more complex decision boundary.
4) Nu is a parameter that controls the trade-off between achieving a low training error and a low testing error. It is used only for the nu-SVC algorithm.
5) Epsilon is a tolerance parameter that specifies the acceptable margin of error for the solution. It is used only for the epsilon-SVR algorithm.
